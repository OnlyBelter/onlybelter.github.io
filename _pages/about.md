Hi, I'm Xin Xiong.

[//]: # (As a bioinformatics researcher, my fervor lies in unraveling the intricate mechanisms governing cellular operations through computational tools, such as machine learning, statistical physics, and bio-network analysis. My aim is to decode these complexities and attain a comprehensive understanding of their functions.)

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics at [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/) under the mentorship of [Prof. Liang Tian](https://physics.hkbu.edu.hk/people/tian-liang), beginning in October 2021. My main area of research involves devising innovative methodologies and tools for analyzing multi-omics data, with a particular focus on addressing fundamental questions in the field of tumor biology.

Prior to starting my Ph.D. studies, I worked as a research assistant at the Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology, where I had the invaluable opportunity to delve into the intricacies of the tumor microenvironment under the guidance of [Prof. Xuefei Li](https://isynbio.siat.ac.cn/Li(x)lab/view.php?id=48). 
Additionally, I gained research experience as a Research Assistant at [ZhuLab](http://www.zhulab.cn) within the Interdisciplinary Research Center on Biology and Chemistry in Shanghai.

I obtained my bachelor's degree (BEng) in Bioengineering from [Xiâ€™an Polytechnic University](https://www.xpu.edu.cn/), and subsequently pursued my master's degree (MEng) in computer science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of [Prof. Hai Zhao](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=133).

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, watching movies, playing badminton, and practicing photography.

## Current and Future Research Interests

---

I have broad interests in bioinformatics, focusing on high-dimensional multi-omics data analysis, gene regulatory networks, and cell-cell interactions. I am passionate about expanding my knowledge in statistics, machine learning, and complex systems to enhance my research capabilities. In addition to developing methods, I am eager to apply these tools to address biological challenges in cancer biology, immunology, and neuroscience, with the goal of understanding the underlying biological mechanisms.

## Research Experience

---

- **Transitioned from Bioinformatics Service to Research**: After gaining valuable bioinformatics experience (Perl/Python/R programming, microarray/sequencing data analysis, etc.) providing services to universities and hospitals for five years, I pursued my passion for independent research by joining ZhuLab as a research assistant.
- **Developed Tools for LC-MS Data Analysis at ZhuLab**: During my three years at ZhuLab, I thrived in a research environment, developing tools for analyzing mass spectrometry data (LC-MS) of natural small molecules in the human body. This experience solidified my bioinformatics expertise.
- **Deconvoluted Cellular Components in the Tumor Microenvironment**: Eager to delve deeper into cancer biology, I joined Dr. Xuefei Li's group. There, I focused on developing a novel method for cellular component deconvolution within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This project formed the foundation for my Ph.D. research at HKBU.
