Welcome! I have been a Research Assistant in the [Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology](http://isynbio.siat.ac.cn/) at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS in Shenzhen, China since Jun 2020. 
I am also a graduate student majored in Computer Technology at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Hai Zhao](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=133). I passed dissertation defense on Jan 6, 2021.

After I earned my BEng in Bioengineering from [Xi'an Polytechnic University](https://www.xpu.edu.cn/) 
I worked at [Genminix](http://www.gminix.com/) (a biotech company) as a developer of new bioinformatic tools for the analysis biological data (Microarray and RNA-Seq). 
I went to [ZhuLab](http://www.zhulab.cn) at [Interdisciplinary Research Center on Biology and Chemistry](http://ircbc.ac.cn/) as a Research Assistant in 2016 and I also started my study as a master student (MEng) at SJTU this year. 
Cooperating with other colleagues, 
I published several papers ([Bioinformatics 2017](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/14/2235/3066291);
                             [Analytical chemistry 2017](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02625);
                             [Nature communications 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09550-x);
                             [Nature communications 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18171-8)) related to the analysis methods of Bio-Mass Spectrometry data.
I am one of the main contributors of the machine-learning-based prediction algorithm for the last article.

In my spare time, I like reading, watching movies and jogging. I also enjoy photography.
